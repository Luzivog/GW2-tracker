# Guild Wars 2 Discord Bot Tracker

This discord bot was made with the intent of tracking the progress of me and a few friends on the mmo rpg guild wars 2. 

It was made using the [gw2 api v2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main) and has only 1 command for the moment (maybe more in the future) that is ``/progress`` and that displays :

If you want to use it you need to fill in config.example.js and rename it to config.js.

You'll also need to install the modules [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) and [cross-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch).

For hosting the discord bot I personally recommend using [fluidnodes](https://fluidnodes.com/) where you can host for free 24/7. It is also really easy to use.
Depending on when you see this fluidnodes may not be a thing anymore.
