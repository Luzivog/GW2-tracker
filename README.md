# Guild Wars 2 Discord Bot Tracker

This discord bot was made with the intent of tracking the progress of me and of a few friends on the mmo rpg guild wars 2.

It has only 1 command for the moment (maybe more in the future) that is ``/progress`` and that displays :

If you want to use it you need to fill in config.example.js and rename config.example.js to config.js.

You'll also need to install the modules ``cross-fetch`` and ``discord.js``.
